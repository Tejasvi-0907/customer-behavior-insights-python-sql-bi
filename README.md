# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis – Python | SQL | Power BI

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using a dataset of 3,900 transactions across various product categories. It follows a complete end-to-end data analytics pipeline, including Python-based data cleaning, SQL-driven insights, Power BI visualizations, and a final business report.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights about customer spending patterns, product performance, discount usage, and subscription behavior. These insights help businesses make informed decisions in marketing, product strategy, and customer retention.

## Dataset Summary

Rows: 3,900

Columns: 18

Includes:

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status)

Purchase behavior (Item Purchased, Category, Amount, Discount, Previous Purchases)

Product attributes (Season, Size, Color)

Delivery details (Shipping Type)

Review metrics (Review Rating)

Missing Values: 37 ratings (handled during cleaning)

## 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

Performed in Python using pandas:

Loaded dataset & explored structure

Imputed missing review ratings using category-wise medians

Standardized column names to snake_case

Engineered new features:

age_group

purchase_frequency_days

Dropped redundant fields (e.g., promo_code_used)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL for analysis

## 2. Data Analysis (SQL)

A series of SQL queries were used to extract business insights, including:

### Key Questions Answered

1- Revenue generated by male vs female customers

2- Discount users who spent above the average purchase amount

3- Top 5 highest-rated products

4- Average purchase amount by shipping type

5- Comparison of spend & revenue between subscribers and non-subscribers

6- Products most dependent on discounts

7- Customer segmentation: New, Returning, Loyal

8- Top 3 products in each category

9- Subscription likelihood among repeat buyers

10- Revenue contribution by age group

11- High-value customers (top 10%) using percentile ranking

12- % of revenue generated from discounted orders

13- Revenue matrix combining Category × Shipping Type

14- First-time vs returning customer order volume

All SQL queries are included in the project.

## 3. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

A fully interactive Power BI dashboard was built with:

KPI cards (Total Customers, Avg Purchase Amount, Avg Rating)

Revenue by Category

Sales by Age Group

Customer Distribution by Subscription Status

Filters for Category, Gender, Shipping Type

Pie, bar, and donut charts for comparison metrics

This dashboard summarizes all key insights visually.
